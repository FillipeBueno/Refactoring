# Website Refactoring

## Description

This project aims to restructure a website, making it more accessible to those who have more difficulty accessing the website, due to a disability such as blindness, but not limited to that. It also aimed to make the site's code more accessible in terms of understanding for the client and also future developers who may work with this site.

### Acessibility

* I made the code more accessible by using the alt tag. Descriptions of the images contained on the website are now available in our version of the code, thus facilitating the understanding of those who use tools such as screen readers, etc.

### Changes 

* Following good practice standards, all "div" tags were removed and replaced by semantic tags, which provide more precise information about the code itself, making understanding and possible changes in the future easier. 

* Tests and changes were carried out around the css file so that there are no bugs when opening the page.
